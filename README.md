## Description 
Present code provides an adaptable apparatus for visualising brain activity associated with any psychological concept from the [Neurosynth database]
(https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/).
This Jupyter Notebook shows an analysis of fMRI EpilepsyÂ data. The notebook produces two informative figures: the first overlays functional data onto structural brain scans to identify areas significantly connected to Epilepsy, and the second presents a histogram of voxel intensities for a more thorough perspective of brain activity.
## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: Matplotlib, Nibabel, Nilearn
- Jupiter Notebook
